req:
app will use Xor for symmetric encryption 
then use rsa for key exchange
basic gui from tkinter
well


basic idea for encpt and dcrpt
user will enter a measg
then app will create a random xor key
that key will be used to then further encpt the measg
then that  Xor KEY IS ENCPT USING RSA PUBLIC KEY AND that key will come from the one getting the measg

FOR NOW LETS CALL THE SENDER A
AND THE ONE GETING THE MEASG B

both will be saved
-----
then B CAN:
dcrpt that key using rsa private key and they themself have
and then dcrpt the measg using that Xor key
